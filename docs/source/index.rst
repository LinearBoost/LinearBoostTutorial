Welcome to LinearBoost's documentation!
======================================

**LinearBoost** is a Python library for classification in machine learning. It is built by boosting a linear classifier, named SEFR. SEFR is the building block for LinearBoost. It is very fast, but not as accurate as state-of-the-art classification algorithms. LinearBoost builds on SEFR by improving its accuracy and taking advantage of its training runtime. 


You can read SEFR `at arXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04620>`_. However, please keep in mind that SEFR is only the building block of LinearBoost (and so, is less accurate than LinearBoost), and the results of LinearBoost are reported in the LinearBoost GitHub Repository.
Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
the way to :ref:`installation`.
